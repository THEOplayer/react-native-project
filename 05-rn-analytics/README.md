# THEOplayer React Native Reference App

THEO Technologies does not provide THEOplayer React Native components. These apps describes how our current THEOplayer iOS and Android SDKs can be wrapped in React Native Bridges. The sample React Native bridge code is provided AS-IS without any explicit nor implicit guarantees. The React Native bridge sample code only provides mapping for a number of commonly used THEOplayer APIs, it is the customerâ€™s responsibility to further expand the mapping and subsequently maintain the code and ensure compatibility with future versions of THEOplayer SDKs.

This is an sample app of THEOplayer - React Native, and this helps to describe the usage of Analytics (Youbora/Conviva) in React Native application of Android and iOS.

Note: To run the app and trace the Analytics session in your Youbora or Conviva account, please add the Youbora/Conviva details in the following files.
