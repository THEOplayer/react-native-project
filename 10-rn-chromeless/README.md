# THEOplayer React Native Reference App

THEO Technologies does not provide THEOplayer React Native components. These apps describes how our current THEOplayer iOS and Android SDKs can be wrapped in React Native Bridges. The sample React Native bridge code is provided AS-IS without any explicit nor implicit guarantees. The React Native bridge sample code only provides mapping for a number of commonly used THEOplayer APIs, it is the customerâ€™s responsibility to further expand the mapping and subsequently maintain the code and ensure compatibility with future versions of THEOplayer SDKs.

This is the Chromeless basic application in React native with theoplayer. This app decribes on how to create a chromeless project of THEOplayer and React Native in Android, iOS and tvOS.
